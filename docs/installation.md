We always recommend installing packages inside of your virtual environment of choice.
E.g.,
```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Once your virtual environment is activated, install ProxyStore and ProxyStore
Extensions with `pip`.
See the [ProxyStore Installation](https://docs.proxystore.dev/main/installation)
for details.
```bash
$ pip install proxystore  # install any extras as needed
$ pip install proxystore-extensions
```
